## Introduction
TODO
<!-- What is the learning algorithm being used to optimize the weights of the neural networks? -->
<!-- What are the parameters (arguments) being used by that algorithm? -->
<!-- What loss function is being used ? -->
<!-- Please, give the equation(s) -->
<!-- For each experiment excepted the last one (shallow network learning from raw data, -->
<!-- shallow network learning from features and CNN): -->

<!-- 1. Select a neural network topology and describe the inputs, indicate how many are
they, and how many outputs? -->

<!-- 2. Compute the number of weights of each model (e.g., how many weights between the
input and the hidden layer, how many weights between each pair of layers, biases,
etc..) and explain how do you get to the total number of weights. -->

<!-- 3. Test at least three different meaningful cases (e.g., for the MLP exploiting raw data,
test different models varying the number of hidden neurons, for the feature-based
model, test pix_p_cell 4 and 7, and number of orientations or number of hidden
neurons, for the CNN, try different number of neurons in the feed-forward part)
describe the model and present the performance of the system (e.g., plot of the
evolution of the error, nal evaluation scores and confusion matrices). Comment the
differences in results. Are there particular digits that are frequently confused?
The CNNs models are deeper (have more layers), do they have more weights than the
shallow ones? explain with one example. -->

<!-- 4. Train a CNN for the chest x-ray pneumonia recognition. In order to do so, complete the
code to reproduce the architecture plotted in the notebook. Present the confusion matrix,
accuracy and F1-score of the validation and test datasets and discuss your results. -->
